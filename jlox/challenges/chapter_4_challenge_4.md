### (Chapter 4, Challenge 4) C-style `/*...*/` block comments
This type of block comment is also found in Java. I have decided to leave out nesting comments for reasons related to familiarty, simplicity and practicality. 
- In both C and Java, these comments do not nest, so `/* a /* b */ c */` would leave ` c*/` uncommented. 
- Implementing a nested version should be manageable but would be a bit complicated. We would need to keep of how many `/*` we have seen so far to know how many times we need to close it. But there are also some edge cases. For example, if we have `/* a /* b */`, should we just comment out ` a /* b `, or is it an incomplete comment? 
- Nesting comments does not seem very practical. Since text inside block comments are ignored anyway, there is no real need to use nested comments to comment out a piece of text already inside a comment, unless the user wanted to write `/*...*/` inside a block comment for some reason.
