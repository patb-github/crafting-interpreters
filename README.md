# Crafting Interpreters

This repository houses two interpreters for Lox, a high-level, dynamically-typed, class-based programming language from the book *Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom.

Most of the code follows the book like a code-along, but there are features from the 'Challenge' sections that I implement myself. 

The whole book can be read for free from the author's website, https://craftinginterpreters.com/index.html.

For an overview of the Lox language, see [Chapter 3](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) of the book.
